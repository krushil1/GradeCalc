# GradeCalc 

Create a Grade Calculation Program called GradeCalc.

Ask the user to enter their 5 HW grades 
Ask the user to enter their 2 Test grades.

Calculator their class average.  HW counts 30% of their grade and Tests count 70%. 
Your program should then use if/else statements to determine their LETTER Grade based on a 10 point scale. 

The user should enter their homework grades in one line separated by spaces
The user should enter their test grades in one line separated by spaces
Display their numerical average and their letter grade. 

Your program should have a main method and two other static methods. Remember that you do not need to create objects to use static methods.

You should use a method to calculate the numerical average (you will need 7 arguments), and another method to determine their letter grade (you will need 1 argument)


Sample Output: 

Hello!  This program will calculate your Class Grade. 
Please enter your 5 HW grades:  87  90  100  90  100 
Please enter your 2 Test Grades:  93  72 
Class Average:  85.77
